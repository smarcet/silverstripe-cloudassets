 * If there are any duplicate file records (2 records pointing to the same file)
 * This task will sync the cloud state between them. If any of them has a live
 * status, all of them will.
 *
 * NOTE: this scenario shouldn't ever happen but there are lots of ways that it
 * CAN happen (I've had this crop up on two different projects) and when it does
 * it causes strange artifacts like thumbnails disappearing.
 *
 * This is a quick fix for sites with duplicate records. I'd suggest writing a
 * script to actually combine duplicates as a long-term solution but that would
 * have to be site-specific.
